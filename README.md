This is a sample app to understand the usage of Content Providers in Android. Specifically, how to access contacts using __ContactsProvider__.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the technicalities of __"Content Providers"__ in Android. I wanted to query all the contacts that are stored in user's phone and show it as a list with contact photo(if any). Juts like how Contacts app does.

## Documentation
The Contacts Provider is a powerful and flexible Android component that manages the device's central repository of data about people. The Contacts Provider is the source of data you see in the device's contacts application, and you can also access its data in your own application and transfer data between the device and online services. The provider accommodates a wide range of data sources and tries to manage as much data as possible for each person, with the result that its organization is complex. Because of this, the provider's API includes an extensive set of contract classes and interfaces that facilitate both data retrieval and modification.
